               <p>
                   Tech' giants' whimsical usage of defunct elements aside, we mostly moved  away from using presentational
                   markup in the 2000s. By making styling the  responsibility of a separate technology—CSS—we were able to
                   manage style  and structure separately. Consequently, a change in art direction would no longer mean
                   reconstituting our content.
               </p>

               <h2>The Reel</h2>
               <div class="reel">
                   <img src="img/reel1.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel2.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel3.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel4.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel5.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel6.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel7.jpg" alt="art" />
               </div>

               <p>
                   When I’m sequencing music, I don’t know how long the track I’m creating is going to be until I’m
                   done. My sequencer software is aware of this and provisions time on demand, as I add bars of sound. J
                   ust as music sequencers dynamically provision time, web pages provision space. If all songs had to be
                   four minutes and twenty six seconds long, or all web pages 768px high, well, that would be needlessly
                   restrictive.
               </p>

               <h2>The Frame</h2>
               <div class="frame">
                   <img src="./img/every-layout-art.jpg" alt="art" />
               </div>

               <p>
                   The Frame is mostly useful for cropping media (videos and images) to a desired aspect ratio. Once you start
                   controlling the aspect ratio, you can of course tailor it to the current circumstances. For example, you
                   might want to give images a different aspect ratio depending on the viewport orientation.
               </p>

               <h2>The Switcher</h2>

               <div class="switcher">

               </div>

               <p>
                   As we set out in Boxes, it’s better to provide suggestions rather than diktats about the way the visu
                   al design is laid out. An overuse of @media breakpoints can easily come about when we try to fix des
                   igns to different contexts and devices. By only suggesting to the browser how it should arrange our la
                   yout boxes, we move from creating multiple layouts to single quantum layouts existing simultaneously
                   in different states.
               </p>

               <h2>The Grid</h2>
               <p>
                   Designers sometimes talk about designing to a grid. They put the grid—a matrix of horizontal and
                   vertical lines—in place first, then they populate that space, making the words and pictures span the
                   boxes those intersecting lines create.
               </p>

               <div class="grid">
                   <div></div>
                   <div></div>
                   <div></div>
                   <div></div>
                   <div></div>
                   <div></div>
                   <div></div>
