               <h2>The problem</h2>
               <p>
                   Tech' giants' whimsical usage of defunct elements aside, we mostly moved  away from using presentational
                   markup in the 2000s. By making styling the  responsibility of a separate technology—CSS—we were able to
                   manage style  and structure separately. Consequently, a change in art direction would no longer mean
                   reconstituting our content.
               </p>

               <div class="reel">
                   <img src="img/reel1.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel2.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel3.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel4.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel5.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel6.jpg" alt="art" />
                   <img src="img/reel7.jpg" alt="art" />
               </div>

               <div class="frame">
                   <img src="./img/every-layout-art.jpg" alt="art" />
               </div>

               <p>
                   The Frame is mostly useful for cropping media (videos and images) to a desired aspect ratio. Once you start
                   controlling the aspect ratio, you can of course tailor it to the current circumstances. For example, you
                   might want to give images a different aspect ratio depending on the viewport orientation.
               </p>

                   This source (an image file such as a PNG, JPEG, or SVG) has certain characteristics outside
                   your control as a writer of CSS. Aspect ratio is one such characteristic, and is determined when
                   the image is originally created and cropped.
